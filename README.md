# Sustain Wellness App
Sustain is a Front-End project from the Mod 2 curriculum at Turing School of Software & Design.
Given a URL containing datasets for all users, sleep logs, activity logs, and hydration logs, we used the Fetch API to retrieve data and update the DOM with a specific userâ€™s information. Concepts introduced during the course of this project included webpack, network requests and responses, and Test Driven Development.

The Sustain wellness app is a useful dashboard for users to view their latest activity, sleep, and hydration data, track their fitness goals, and celebrate milestones.

### Design Inspiration
For this project we sourced design inspiration from Dribble creators:

- [Elegant Themes](https://dribbble.com/shots/14045055-Fitness-Coach-Landing-Page-Design-for-Divi): Bright, complementary colors on a neutral/white background
- [Halo Lab](https://dribbble.com/shots/17257234-Gig-Share-Dashboard): Cards for different sections that have rounded corners; each data set (activity, sleep, hydration) has its own corresponding color
- [Hasnur Alam Ujjol](https://dribbble.com/shots/16491774-Fitness-Workout-App-UI-Design): Light and dark theme; everything is modular and self-contained; not too much white space and not too much extraneous info on the page
